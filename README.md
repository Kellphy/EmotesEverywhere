# Kellphy's Emotes Everywhere
1. Directly get, search or browse for an emote. Capitalization does **NOT** matter.\
(Ex: POGGERS = poggers = Poggers)
2. Get the emote as a RGB / DiB / Link on your clipboard OR Drag & Drop it (best).

When wish to have new emotes added, press the **[Request Emotes]** button, join the Discord Server, and contact me.
