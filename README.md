# Kellphy's Emotes Everywhere

## Because of compatibility and performance issues with new Windows versions, the project will be slowly moved to web: https://new.kellphy.com/emotes

1. Search, browse and edit emotes. Capitalization does **NOT** matter.\
(Ex: POGGERS = poggers = Poggers)
2. Get the emote as a **RGB** / **DiB** / **Link** / **File** on your clipboard OR **Drag & Drop** it (best).

When wish to have new emotes added, visit **[Discord and Requests]**, join the Discord Server, and contact me.
